      <h1 class="cardText">Who am I?</h1>
      <h1 class="smallCardText">I am a 12 year old boy who likes coding. A lot. In fact, I like coding so much, I made like 3 desktop projects, tic tac toe for android (not iphone because developing on there is a nightmare, I tried.), some discord bots (I actually coded them, didn't use a starter website), and multiple other websites. Here are some of my projects:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Tic Tac Toe (Desktop) [No github for this]</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Danx3mer/Public-Minesweeper">Minesweeper (Desktop)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Danx3mer/WarshipBattle">Battleships (Desktop)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Danx3mer/Mobile-TicTacToe">Tic Tac Toe (Mobile) [Github link]</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kt.game.tictactoe">Tic Tac Toe (Mobile) [Google Play store link]</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Danx3mer/">My github (Where I store all of my important coding information)</a></li>

      <h1 class="cardText">Why should you care?</h1>
      <h1 class="smallCardText">Your vote can help decide who will be the student council representative of 720! However, this isn't without its flaws. Whoever you vote for will go on to suggest some changes for the school that you may/may not like. How do I solve this issue? I don't suggest my ideas right away, I listen to what everyone has to say, and then decide what to tell the council!</h1></span>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h1 class="cardText">Why vote for me?</h1>
      <h1 class="smallCardText">As mentioned above, if you will vote for me, I will listen to your ideas, not just mine or my friends' ideas. Here are some ideas that I have. If you don't like them, don't worry! I will not be putting them into effect until after I ask all of you about what you think about them!</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Make the school CLEAN. (Fix the bathrooms, they are dirty and some of the sinks don't even have handles!)</li>
			<li>Stock up on supplies. (Like tissues and hand sanitizer (According to Michael M from 716 only 33% of the bottles with hand sanitizer have sanitzer in them!))</li>
			<li>Make periods have breaks in between them. (Up to five minutes)</li>
		</ol>
		<h1 class="smallCardText">Again, if you don't like these, or if you absolutely hate them, just tell me and I will remove the ideas.</h1>
      </div>
	  	<h1 class="smallCardText" style="background-color: black;">SPECIAL THANKS TO MICHAEL M FOR GIVING ME SOME IDEAS!</h1>
